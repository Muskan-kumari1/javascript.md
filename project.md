# 1.  What Is javascript

- JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages.
- Invented in 1995 at Netscape Corporation.

- It is a case-sensitive language.


# 2.  How to Set Up VsCode

- Step 1:- Search on Google or Chrome Download VsCode.
- Step 2:- click on the first link.
  
  - VsCode Download :-

# 3.  What can Javascript do?
- **Interact with Users**: It can respond to user actions like clicking buttons, filling out forms, or moving the mouse. This makes websites interactive, allowing things like dropdown menus, image sliders, and games.
  
- **Update Web Pages**: JavaScript can change the text, images, and layout of a web page without needing to reload the whole page.*
  
- **Form Validation**: JavaScript can check data in forms to ensure correct and complete information is submitted.
  
- **Responsive Design**: JavaScript can adjust the page layout based on screen size or device, making the website look good on both mobile and desktop.

# 4. How to use Javascript with HTML?

   Using the <script> tag integrates JavaScripts into an HTML page .this tag allows to directly write JavaScripts code within your HTML file.
      
# 5. HOW to use internal Javascript?

**Internal JavaScript**: Code is written directly within an HTML file, inside the <script> tags.

  ```js
  <script type = "text/javascript">
  //js code goes here
  <script>
  ```

# 6. How to use external Javascript?
 **External JavaScript**: Code is written in a separate .js file and linked to an HTML file using the <script> tag with the src attribute. 

  ```js
  <script scr = "myscript.js"></script>
  ```

# 8. Functions in Javascript
  
>**Function**
>:- Functions are group of code or program which is used more often.
>It leads programming to code resusability and clear code.

>**Types**
>1. Pre defined Function.
>2. User defined Function.

**1.Pre defined Function**.
>:- Such functions one defined at the time of making of any language.

```bash
console.log("Hello Wrold");
```

**2.User defined Function**.
>:- Such function are defined by users according to their needs.
## Example

```bash
function greetUser(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}


greetUser("Muskan"); 

```
## Output
Output: Hello, Muskan!

# 9. important functions of Javascript.
   
>1. alert() function
>2. confirm() function
>3. console.log() function
>4. document.write() function
>5. prompt() function
> 

**alert() function**
* It is used to alert the user that something has happened.
  
 ```js
     <script type = "text/javascript">
       alert("Hello wrold");
     </script>
 ```

**console.log()**
* Writes information to the browser console, good for debugging purposos.

 ```js
  <script type> = "text/javascript">
  
  console.log("Hello World");

</script>

 ```
**document.write() function**
  
* document.write(): write directly to the HTML document.
  
```js
  <script type ="text/javascript">
    
  document.write("Hello World");
    
  </script>
```

**Prompt() function**

Prompt(msg,default): create an dialogue for user input.

  ```js
  <script type ="text/javascript">
    prompt("hello","Wscube");
  </script>
  ```



    
 # 10. Variable in Javascript

**What is a Variable**
Variables are Containers which hold reusable data.
It is the basic unit of storage in program.
The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.

**Example**

```bash
let a=5;
console.log(a);
```

## Output
5



# 11.  What is an Operator and Type of Operators in Js

**Operator**
> :- An operator is a symbol that tell the compiler which arithmetic or logical operation to be performed between the respective operands.



**Types**
>1. Arithmetic Operators.
>2. Logical Operators.
>3. Assignment Operators.
>4. Comparison / Relational Operators.

**1. Artithmetic Operators**.
>Javascript arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical calculations between variables and/or values.
>These include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), modulus (%), increment (++), and decrement (--).



**2. Assignment Operators.**.
>An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.
> The simple assignment operator is equal ( = ), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand.



**4. Comparison / Relational Operators.**
>Relational operators compare two operands and return true or false depending on the validity of the comparison.
>The most common relational operators are: > (greater than) < (less than)




# 12. String Concatenation in Javascript

- String concatenation in JavaScript is the process of combining two or more strings into one. This can be done using the + operator or template literals.
   ## Example
  
```bash
let firstName = 'Muskan';
let lastName = 'Thakur';
let fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;
console.log(fullName);
```

## Output

Muskan Thakur


## 13. Array in javascripts

- In JavaScript, an array is a variable that can hold multiple values, each accessed by an index number starting from 0.

# Example:

```bash
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];

console.log(fruits[0]); 
console.log(fruits[1]);
console.log(fruits[2]); 

```
## Output
 Apple
 Banana
 Cherry




# 16.Event Handling in Javascript   
- Event handling in JavaScript involves attaching event listeners to DOM elements to respond to various events. Hereâ€™s the syntax and an example for event handling:
- Syntax
``` bash
element.addEventListener(event, function);
```

 ## Example
## HTML
```bash
<body>
  <button id="myButton">Click Me!</button>

  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
```
## JavaScript (script.js)
```bash
const button = document.getElementById('myButton');


function handleClick() {
  alert('Button was clicked!');
}

button.addEventListener('click', handleClick);

```
# 17. LOOP IN JS
 
  **Loop**
> Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
>
> **Types of Loop**
  1. for Loop
  2. Infinite Loop
  3. while Loop
  4. do-while loop
  
## for Loop
 ```bash
    let i =1;
   for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) 
     {
       console.log("Hello world");
     }
   ```
   # Output 
   Hello world
   Hello world
   Hello world
   Hello world
   Hello world
   

 ## Infinite Loop:- 
 ```bash
  while (true) {
    console.log("This will print forever");
}
```
  ## Output
  This loop will run indefinitely, continuously printing the message to the console.
  
  ## while Loop:-
                while (condition) {
                // do some work
                     }
                     
## Program              
```bash
let count = 1;

while (count <= 5)
{
  console.log(count);
  count++;
}
```
## output
1 2 3 4 5

## do-while Loop

         do{
          //do some work
         }while(condition);
         
## Program              
```bash

let count = 1;


do {
  console.log(count);
  count++;
} while (count <= 5);

```
## output
1 2 3 4 5 
 ## Conclusion
In this project, we successfully built a simple yet functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This exercise not only demonstrated the power of combining these three technologies but also emphasized key programming concepts such as:
